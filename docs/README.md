#Commands

You can generate memes by using the following arguments:

```
[meme id] "text1" "text2" ...
```

Depending of the number of `"text"` arguments, several behavior occurs:
* **None**: you get the template that gives you locations of texts. (see below)
* **Less than the template's**: the remaining texts are blank on the output
* **More than the template's**: the extra arguments are ignored

> Notes
> * You don't have to use all texts shown on templates
> * You can use an empty text argument ( `""` ) to skip a text and keep it blank

#List of templates
